    "### Assignment Overview\n",
    "In this assignment, you will build a sign language translator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Objectives of This Assignment are:**\n",
    "1. To perform a classification task on image data, using the K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm from the SciKit-Learn library (https://sklearn.org/).\n",
    "2. To understand domain-independent evaluation measures.\n",
    "3. To understand the impact meta-parameters have in algorithm performance\n",
    "4. To develop a tool that uses the classification model that was developed.\n",
    "5. To get practice discussing / explaining your results, findings, and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Assume that you are the Director of Data Science for American Signing, Inc. (ASI), a company that provides innovative sign-language solutions.  ASI has new technology that can capture American Sign Language images in real time.  ASI would like your team to design a new product that can translate ASL images to text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things To Do\n",
    "The follow the instructions for each step in the sections below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- This dataset has exactly the same format as the \"standard\" MNIST dataset that is widely used.  See the link below for the documentation of the dataset.  You also can search for MNIST in the web.\n",
    "  - This dataset was pulled on 4/13/23 from: https://www.kaggle.com/code/madz2000/cnn-using-keras-100-accuracy\n",
    "  - See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database\n",
    "  - These are 28x28 gray-scale pixel images, with 256-color (or gray-scale) values.\n",
    "- You will use the KNN classifier that is provided in the SciKit Learn library (similar to the Case Studies you have done).  You do not need to write your own.\n",
    "- You will be adjusting the number of training records for the exercise (so it runs reasonably fast), so you do not need to run the algorithm on \"all\" training records.\n",
    "- Some code is provided (partially filled in) to assist in the development of the final product - this is a starting point.  You may adjust it as you choose.\n",
    "- By the way, this exercise is identical to one where, for example, the images are medical scans, etc., and you are trying to classify cells as diseased or healthy.  (There are lots of MNIST examples on the web.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential that you **communicate** your goals, thought process, actions, results, and conclusions to the **audience** that will consume this work.  It is **not enough** to show just the code.  It is not appropriate to show long sections of **unexplained printout**, etc.  Be kind to your readers and provide value to them!\n",
    "\n",
    "**ALWAYS follow this pattern** when doing **each portion** of the work.  This allows us to give feedback and assign scores, and to give partial credit.  Make it easy for the reader to understand your work.\n",
    "- Say (briefly) **what** you are trying to do, and **why**.\n",
    "- Do it (code).\n",
    "- Show or describe the **result** clearly (and briefly as needed), and explain the significant **conclusions or insights** derived from the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "**HAVE FUN!**"
